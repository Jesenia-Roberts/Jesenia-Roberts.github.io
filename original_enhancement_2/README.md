# CS-300
The problem that I was solving for the projects in this course was storing, sorting, and pulling different courses from a list of courses, as well as checking to make sure that all prerequisites listed were courses that existed. I overcame this by studying the various data structures and deciding which was best in order to complete the assignment. Data structures are important to learn about so that as a programmer you know the best structure to use for different situations. When I had a roadblock I used to resources given to me by the class. This work has expanded my understanding of programming as I am now more well-learned in data structures. This will ultimately make my code better and more efficient in the future.
